comparisons

vs Unreal: // very static and cumbersome
    first-class functions
    first-class macros
    substitution
    
    in 4.9.2 no sorting function implemented
        and it's a commercial product
        
        one of the possible areas where a visual language would be handy for anyone, regardless of programming experience is rapid prototyping
        
        if it's static like Blueprint this advantage is greatly diminished
    w/o first-class functions the more cumbersome to implement
    

General desirable characteristics of a scripting language:
	dynamic
	flexible
	suitable for rapid prototyping
	library of basic functions
	complementary to a non-scripting language
	
Unreal Engine
	nope
	static
	rigid
	no sort
	
	does not really complement C++, which is also static and rigid
