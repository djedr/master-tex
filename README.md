# Excerpt from Introduction
This research spans a fairly broad area of knowledge, connecting -- in order of importance -- programming language design, web technologies, web application design and development as well as computer game development.

The main focus of this thesis is designing a programming language, which can have multiple deeply integrated editable representations.

I present a way to combine features of visual languages and text-based languages in an integrated development environment, which lets the programmer work with both representations in parallel or intertwine them in various ways.

A proof-of-concept interpreter and development environment for the language is implemented using web technologies.

Practical demonstration of the capabilities of the implementation is presented by writing a Pac-Man clone in the designed language. This also provides a reference for assessing the performance of the implementation.
