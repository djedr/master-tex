\chapter{Prototype implementation}\label{chap:impl}

\section{Programming discipline}
The prototype was implemented largely in the spirit of exploratory programming:
``the kind where you decide what to write by writing
it.''\cite{arc}.

This approach in combination with a dynamic and flexible language like
JavaScript enables one to quickly transform ideas to working prototypes and
shape them as one goes along. But the usefulness of this method is limited, as
it may quickly produce fairly low-quality code, as it is not focused on future
maintainability.
