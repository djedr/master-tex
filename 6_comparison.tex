\chapter{Comparisons to other VPLs}\label{chap:comp}
This chapter compares Dual to the Blueprints Visual Scripting system of Unreal Engine 4 and to MIT Scratch.


General desirable characteristics of a scripting language:
\begin{itemize}
    \item dynamic
    \item flexible
    \item suitable for rapid prototyping
    
    \item library of basic functions
    \item complementary to a non-scripting language
\end{itemize}
    

Blueprints:
\begin{itemize}
    \item static, rigid, cumbersome
    \item no autostructuring
    \item no text representation
    \item no first-class functions
    \item no first-class macros?
    \item no sorting function available out of the box in 4.9.2
    
        and it's a commercial product
        basic functionality needs external libraries
        "The low-entry extended standard library has a sort array by comparator function, which is what you'd need here."

    \item  difficult source control
    
    p4 was a nightmare
    
    diffing, etc. limited to the editor
    
    \item  Blueprint does not really complement C++, which is also static and rigid
    
    rather: it intersects C++'s feature set; and it's poor at that: slow and incomplete
    
    \item not very good for rapid prototyping because of the above
\end{itemize}
    
BLUI, Coherent: web platform for UIs everywhere
        
   
    
Scratch:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  no first-class functions
    \item  limited file I/O?
    \item  educational
    \item  in Flash/ActionScript
    \item  only supports one-dimensional arrays, known as "lists"
    \item  Floating point scalars and strings are supported as of version 1.4, but with limited string manipulation ability.
\end{itemize}
    
        % also show that Scratch is inferior, e.g. having no first-class functions
        % mention that there are derivatives that try to fix that

Snap!
    Scratch successor that fixes its shortcomings
    first class truly object oriented sprites with prototyping inheritance, and nestable sprites, which are not part of Scratch
